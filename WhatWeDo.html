    <h3>What Are We Here For?</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Having Fun!</strong></dt>
            <dd>First and foremost, it's important that everyone who shows up has fun. We maintain a relaxed and low stakes environment at our practices in order to cater to everyone. We don't run drills or do conditioning... instead we use the time that we have to scrimmage. This makes it so that any level of experience is welcome!</dd>
            <dt><strong>Making Friends</strong></dt>
            <dd>Getting involved in organizations is one of the best ways to make friends. The people in them usually have the sam interests as you so it's easy to get along. The soccer club is no different. We have had up to 60 people show up on any given night, so come on out!</dd>
            <dt><strong>Improvement</strong></dt>
            <dd>Since we are available to all skill levels, we have many experienced and competitive players who show up. These players are not just looking to have fun, but to improve themselves and others. Practice makes perfect and showing up is the first step!</dd>
