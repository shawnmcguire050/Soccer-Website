    <h3>What Should You Bring?</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Cleats</strong></dt>
            <dd>Cleats are recommended but not mandatory. Cleats will allow you to have maximum traction and prevent slipping so that you can play without any distraction. If you don't have cleats that's fine, tennis shoes are a suitable alternative.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Athletic Clothes</strong></dt>
            <dd>Soccer is a very active sport, and if you show up in jeans, you'll regret it afterwards. A pair of shorts and a t-shirt is all you need!</dd>
            <dt><strong>That's It!</strong></dt>
            <dd>The club will bring the soccer balls, scrimmage pinnies, cones, and goals. We try to make it as easy as possible for you guys!</dd>
